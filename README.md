**Data Structures and Algorithms**

This repository contains a collection of essential data structures and algorithms implemented in multiple programming languages. Each data structure and algorithm is explained with clear examples, code, and tests to help developers and students understand these fundamental concepts. The repo is organized to support learning, technical interviews, and competitive programming.

### Topics Included
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS), Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and Divide and Conquer.

### Highlights
- **Easy-to-follow explanations** for each topic
- **Code implementations** with comments for clarity
- **Example usage** and real-world applications
- **Unit tests** to validate each implementation

Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, brushing up on programming basics, or learning new algorithms, this repo is a valuable resource for building a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.
